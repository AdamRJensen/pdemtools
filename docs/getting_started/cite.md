A software paper is being prepared for the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/). In the meantime, the use of the pDEMtools package can be cited as follows:

> Chudley, T. R. and Howat, I. M. (2024) pDEMtools (vX.X). GitHub. https://github.com/trchudley/pDEMtools

or by using `bibtex`:

```
@software{pDEMtools
   author = {Chudley, Thomas R. and Howat, Ian M.}, title = {pDEMtools}, year = 2023, publisher = {GitHub}, version = {X.X}, url = {https://github.com/trchudley/pDEMtools} 
}
```

When using ArcticDEM and REMA products, please [cite](../appendix/references.md) the datasets appropriately and [acknowledge](../appendix/acknowledgements.md) the PGC.

Several algorithms implemented in the library were developed by others. These will be highlighted in the documentation, and the original authors should be properly cited when used. For example:

> We masked sea ice and melange following the method of Shiggins _et al._ (2023) as implemented in pDEMtools (Chudley, 2023).
